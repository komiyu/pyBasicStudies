# pyBasicStudies
Basic Study for python3, and it contains some content and demo code.
I have studied the programmings from 2015, and I have tried hard for java, javascript, cocos-2d(c, c++), python, bash(linux).
But I forgetted a lot during different topics. 
So I decided......
I have started this project from 2018.01.23, and I hoped I would be expert in python.
